_To whom it may concern,_

This is in regard to a recommendation I received about an internship
opportunity for this summer (2019) due to your involvement and usage of
open source software because I am a heavy advocate / developer / user.
I believe that with that the skills I have developed within server
admin and in and around open source that I am the ideal match for the
position.

I became aware of open source a number of years ago and have been
ramping up from purely a user to a contributor and producer. My efforts
paid off in summer of 2018 when I was given a place at Google Summer
of Code with VideoLAN working on VLC, reverse engineering, documenting,
and implementing the AirPlay protocol as a render target so that a user
may cast arbitrary media to an airplay-enabled device. Needless to say
that it was a really rewarding experience to give back to the community
that given so much to me for so many years (not to mention hanging out
with some of my FOSS idols).

I am looking for the same rewarding work this summer and was intrigued
by your emphasis on open source. I also run and maintain a rack
mount hypervisor at home as a hobby so building a better understanding
of GNU/Linux is also highly desirable.

I have a very high standard for myself and my software and will strive
to ensure everything I do is exceptional. This is shown in my
web browser. I am additionall a very fast learner and can be effective
anywhere, evidenced by my ability to jump in way over my head and
reverse engineer and implement AirPlay's cryptographic protocol with
little prior crypto experience. I am also flexible with working hours
and remote work, having experienced with it with my mentor at VideoLAN
who is based in France.
