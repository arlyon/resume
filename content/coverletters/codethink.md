_To whom it may concern,_

This letter is in regards to a recommendation I received about an internship
opportunity for this summer (2019) due to your involvement in and use of
open source software. I believe that with the skills I have developed in
and around open source that I am the ideal match for the position.

I became aware of open source a number of years ago and have in the
last year gone from a user to a contributor. My efforts paid off in the
summer of 2018 when I was given a place at Google Summer of Code with
VideoLAN working on VLC. Needless to say that it was a really rewarding
experience to give back to a community that gave me so much for so
many years (not to mention hanging out with some of my FOSS idols).

I am looking for similarly rewarding work this summer and I am intrigued
by Codethink's emphasis on open source. Furthermore, I maintain a
hypervisor at home as a hobby, so building a better understanding of
Debian (now that IBM acquired redhat) is also highly desirable along
with anything from my list of DevOps goals (networking,
ansible/saltstack, infrastructure provision, containers, etc). A chance
to attend conferences would be a bonus.

The standard I set for myself and my software is very high and I strive
to ensure every project I take on is exceptional. This is shown by the
test suite and design patterns employed in my web browser
implementation. I am additionally a fast, independent learner, and
can be effective with any technology evidenced by my ability to reverse
engineer and implement AirPlay's cryptographic protocol with
little prior crypto experience. I am also experienced with flexible
working hours and remote work, having handled all team communication
with my mentor at VideoLAN over IRC. I found my mentoring to be
extremely beneficial and am looking for someone who is able to help me
continue to grow professionally.
