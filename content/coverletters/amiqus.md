_To whom it may concern,_

I was recently made aware of a part-time position at Amiqus and believe
I am an ideal candidate. My brief exposure to Amiqus was interesting
and the problems you are solving and company attitude are very appealing.
Up until now, I have exclusively contributed to free open source
software because I value accessibility and empowerment and the
technology Amiqus is working on is very compatible with that ideology.

Contributing to so many different projects across
languages and paradigms has left me with many transferable skills
making picking up new technologies much easier. The most recent example
of this is the C programming language which, to prepare for my
internship at VLC, I learned from scratch in 4 months. Another benefit
of working with open source is the communication skills I have gained.
Coordinating with so many people remotely from different backgrounds
and skill levels requires patience and friendliness.

I am applying for this opportunity due to my Soft.Eng. course leaving
me with a lot of free time. My goals are to learn about the
technology and the startup industry as a whole.

You may reach me at any time at 07434848282, or via email at
arlyon@me.com. I am more than happy to elaborate on any project
or technology listed (and some that aren't).
