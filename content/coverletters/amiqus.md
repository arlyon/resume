_To whom it may concern,_

I was recently made aware of a part time position at Amiqus and believe
I am an ideal candidate. My brief exposure to Amiqus was interesting
and the problems you are solving and company attitude is very appealing.
Up until now I have exclusively contributed to free open source
software because I value accessibility and empowerment and the
technology Amiqus is working on seems to be very compatible with
that ideology.

In contributing to so many different projects across
languages and paradigms I am very flexible with picking up new
systems, such as the C programming language during my internship
at VLC which I learned from scratch in 4 months.

I am applying because my Comp. Eng. course leaves me with a lot of
free time and I would like to learn about startups in Edinburgh.

You may reach me at any time at 07434848282, or via email at
arlyon@me.com. I am more than happy to elaborate on any project
or technology listed (and some that aren't).
