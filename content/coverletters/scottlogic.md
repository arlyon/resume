_Dear Alison,_

This letter is in regards to a software development internship in Edinburgh
at Scott Logic summer 2019. Having had a few interactions with Scott Logic
before, I was impressed by the professionalism and quality that they
demonstrated and believe that my skills complement those ideals. Being
in my penultimate year at Heriot Watt, I am looking for something
challenging to work on and the autonomy you have provided to interns in
the past attractive.

I have recently become very interested in large scale development and
deployment as well as mercilessly adhering to best practices when it
comes to "data-hygiene", infrastructure provisioning, backups,
deployment automation, continuous integration and deployment, and
(of course) code quality. I got the impression at your last event
at Heriot Watt that these practices are core to your success and are
taken very seriously and I want to learn all I can so that I may apply
it to my own work.

That said, however, because I want to learn does not mean I have
not come a good distance on my own. I maintain a server at home which I
use to practice the aforementioned techniques (CI, CD, etc). I am already
technically proficient in many popular technologies and can become
effective with new ones in a matter of days. Additionally, I can take on
problems, identify holes in my understanding, and devise solutions fairly
independently as evidenced by my ability to reverse engineer and
implement AirPlay's cryptographic protocol with little prior crypto
experience.

The standard I set for myself and my software is very high and I strive
to ensure every project I take on is exceptional. My last internship was
extremely beneficial and I am looking for someone who is able to help me
continue to grow professionally.
