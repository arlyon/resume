_Dear Hiring manager,_

I was recommended by my course director at Heriot-Watt University that
I seek you out due to my interest in low-level computing. Having worked
on VLC for Google Summer of Code 2018 I am interested in continuing with
high-performance computing and toolchain development is a (so far
unexplored) interest of mine. I believe that, combined with the skills
I have, my drive positions me as a strong candidate for this position.

Having enjoyed my computer architecture course last year, VLC provided a
low-level performance-critical environment to work in which I really
enjoyed. My work reverse-engineering and implementing the AirPlay
protocol was self-guided which allowed me to have contact with many
codec devs talking about chasing down performance gains. My project was
primarily around cryptography and
networking, however, the multimedia scene opened my eyes up to the world
of high-performance computing to which Codeplay is the toolchain analog.

I already have experience with large C codebases having pushed 4k loc to
VLC and strive to ensure every project I take on is exceptional. For
proof of this, you may look at my [airplay implementation][1] or
[mastermind implementation][2]. I am already familiar with CMake and make
and comfortable using debuggers such as gdb and profilers such as
Valgrind. I am otherwise a strong programmer and have covered the basics
of compilers, code security, and memory management at university. In
addition to this, I maintain a server at home and I am comfortable with
Windows, Linux, and command line interfaces.

I would be delighted to talk with you about where I would best fit
within the Codeplay. Having worked remotely I have developed excellent
verbal and written communication skills and can contribute to any team.
