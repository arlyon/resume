My development career was kickstarted by github. It is the platform
that got me reading code, that allowed me to contribute to my first
project, and the one that hosted my projects for the world to see.
It was (thanks to my public projects) an integral part of getting a
place in Google Summer of Code this year.

Continuing the theme from working on VLC last year, this year I would
like to contribute to a another piece of software that I use. Having
spoken to an employee at GitHub in Edinburgh, it sounds like a perfect
match.

As you will see, I have honed my skills over a diverse set of projects
from client/server to web apps, desktop apps, video games, cryptography,
low level, high level, etc. This wide skill range has meant that I am
highly adaptable and fairly technology agnostic proven by my ability
to learn reverse engineering, technical writing, crypto protocols, and
the C programming language to a respectable level during my internship
reverse engineering AirPlay.

With this passion for the platforms I use daily, and my ability to
handle any problem thrown at me I believe I will be a valuable member
on the GitHub team.

You may reach me at any time at +44 7434848282, or via email at
arlyon@me.com. I am more than happy to elaborate on any project
or technology listed (and some that aren't).
