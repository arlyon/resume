  I spend my free time tinkering with software, in all capacities.
  I am a quick adopter of new technologies and ideas and like to
  try new libraries and techniques as often as I can, enjoying the
  process of rapid prototyping and development. As a result I have a
  working knowledge of different platforms and frameworks from
  c# to python to javascript. I am currently working through a textbook
  on functional programming and look forward to adding lisp to the list.
  In addition to software, at home I enjoy running a small server where
  I have been able to practice skills relating to database management,
  web hosting, virtual machines, systemctl, bash, and network security
  (helped heavily by the CCNA course at University). The future for me
  is to try and source better hardware so that I can make my automated
  youtube video recycling bot a reality.
